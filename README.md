# LLM Computer Controller

**✨ Vibe-coded with [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) ✨**

This project is an Electron-based desktop application for macOS that allows you to control your computer using natural language commands processed by a Large Language Model (LLM).

It leverages the OpenAI API and provides tools for the LLM to interact with your system, including:

*   Listing installed applications
*   Opening files, folders, or applications by path
*   Searching for files using Spotlight
*   Executing arbitrary AppleScript for more complex tasks
*   Reading the content of specified files

The goal is to provide a powerful, flexible, and conversational interface for interacting with your macOS environment.
